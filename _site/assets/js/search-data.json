    "content": "We’re so excited to release Just the Docs v0.4.0. This release has been almost a year in the making - after our new maintenance team has taken over the project, we’ve added two years of backlogged features and bugfixes to modernize the theme. This CHANGELOG will summarize some of the key changes, discuss migrations strategies, and outline broad future plans for this theme. Brief Overview - Highlighted Changes . v0.4.0 contains many new features and bugfixes. We enumerate all of them in further sections in this changelog; however, we’d like to call out some of the most-requested changes: . | better support for dark theme: dark highlighting, search input color | callouts, a new design component to highlight content | configuring mermaid.js, a markdown-native diagram visualization library | copy code button for code snippets | external navigation links | major improvements to nav generation efficiency and robustness | minor improvements to built-in accessibility (SVG icons, nav titles, skip to main content) | modularized site components (advanced feature) | new custom includes: table of contents heading, navigation panel footer, search placeholder, lunr search indices | bugfixes involving WEBrick and Ruby 3, Liquid processing in CSS comments, nested task lists, relative URLs, scroll navigation, corrupted search data from rake, breadcrumbs, and more! | more documentation for custom includes, this changelog, and the migration guide | . After usage instructions and the roadmap, we enumerate all changes from v0.3.3. Using Release v0.4.0 . Unlike pre-releases, v0.4.0 is a new semver minor release for the theme. That means that users who have not pinned the theme version will be automatically upgraded to v0.4.0 the next time they build their site. To use this release explicitly as a remote theme: . remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs@v0.4.0 . To use this RC explicitly as a gem-based theme, pin the version in your Gemfile and re-run bundle install or bundle update just-the-docs: . gem \"just-the-docs\", \"0.4.0\" . If you would prefer to not upgrade, you can enforce that explicitly: . | pin your gem version in your Gemfile, like so gem \"just-the-docs\", \"0.3.3\" . | freeze the remote_theme, like so remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs@v0.3.3 . | . Migration Guide and Strategies . We’ve developed a new migration guide for users to migrate from version v0.3.3 to v0.4.0. It outlines major changes in project maintenance (e.g. new repository link, team) as well as breaking changes that may break your site (and potential solutions). We suggest that all users refer to the guide before manually upgrading their site. For the vast majority of users, we do not anticipate that this will be a breaking change. The major touch points are surrounding new includes, navigation (ordering, pages, and collections), the favicon, and a shift to relative URLs. However, users who heavily customize the theme (primarily by overriding includes) will likely have to make minor changes. Given the length of features added in this release, users may want to incrementally upgrade through the pre-releases. To follow this approach, read this changelog from v0.4.0.rc1 to v0.4.0.rc5; this breaks down the release into small chunks, each of which should be easier to upgrade. v0.4.0.rc5 is identical to this release. For support with migrating to v0.4.0, open an issue or start a discussion and let us know! . Roadmap (What’s Next?) . Moving forward, we plan to release more frequently with smaller, bite-sized changes. This should make it easier for users to upgrade in the future! . Broadly, many features are still on the radar. We anticipate the rest of v0.4.x to be bugfixes surrounding this new release. For version v0.5, our roadmap includes: . | a theme toggle (light/dark mode), with automatic theme switching based on browser preferences | better GDPR compliance for analytics | multi-level/recursive navigation (unlimited hierarchy of child pages) | . In future versions, we also plan on: . | adding better dark theme defaults | adding better internationalization support | exploring offline PDF generation | improving accessibility within the theme | improving search functionality | refactoring and improving the robustness of our codebase | . Have ideas for what’s next, or want to get involved? Open an issue or start a discussion and let us know! We’re looking for more contributors and maintainers to help us develop the theme.

Big ones include fixing the rake command, using relative_url, and search input color | More documentation, especially on using custom includes | Updating core dependencies to stable Ruby versions | A WIP template repository that allows you to setup your own repository using Just the Docs and GitHub Pages with one click - give it a shot!

Use of branches for closed PRs (e.g., #466, #578) is now deprecated, as those branches have been (directly or indirectly) merged, and they may be deleted after the pre-release of v0.4.0.rc1. Maintenance . Internally, our maintainer team has expanded: Patrick Marsceill, the original maintainer, has stepped down from an active role after almost 4 years! We’re very thankful for the work that he’s done to create and maintain one of the most popular Jekyll themes. Please join us in giving him thanks! . The new core team currently consists of @mattxwang, @pdmosses, @skullface, @dougaitken, and @max06. Over the past six months, we’ve been triaging and merging in PRs, as well as contributing our own fixes. We’ll continue to address open issues, merge in PRs from the community, and plan out the future of Just the Docs. If you’d like to contribute, now is a great time! . Roadmap . In the short-term, we’re committed to tidying up everything for a v0.4.0 release. This involves fixing bugs reported from the community in this pre-release, as well as continually merging in minor PRs. We’re also scoping out medium and long-term projects, and want to keep you in the loop. These include: . | upgrading to Jekyll 4, and stopping support for Jekyll 3 | versioned docs - issue #728 | improved accessibility - issues #566, #870 | internationalization (i18n) - issue #59 | recursive/multi-level navigation - PR #462 | toggleable dark mode - issue #234 | . as well as DX improvements like better regression tests, CI, and tooling. If you’re interested in any of these, please join us on GitHub - any contribution (raising an issue, writing docs, or submitting a PR) is welcome! .

Just the Docs is a theme for generating static websites with Jekyll. You can write source files for your web pages using [Markdown], the [Liquid] templating language, and HTML.1 Jekyll builds your site by converting all files that have [front matter] to HTML. Your [Jekyll configuration] file determines which theme to use, and sets general parameters for your site, such as the URL of its home page. Jekyll builds this Just the Docs theme docs website using the theme itself. These web pages show how your web pages will look by default when you use this theme. But you can easily [customize] the theme to make them look completely different! . Browse the docs to learn more about how to use this theme. ",

To get started with creating a site, just click “[use the template]”! . To use the theme, you do not need to clone or fork the [Just the Docs repo]! You should do that only if you intend to browse the theme docs locally, contribute to the development of the theme, or develop a new theme based on Just the Docs. You can easily set the site created by the template to be published on [GitHub Pages] – the [template README] file explains how to do that, along with other details. If Jekyll is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site locally. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.2 And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages. More specifically, the created site: . | uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a Gemfile and loads the just-the-docs gem | uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages | . Other than that, you’re free to customize sites that you create with the template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of just-the-docs and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins. See the theme [README][Just the Docs README] for how to use the theme as a gem without creating a new site. ",
