# Welcome to My Cybersecurity Journey

I’m excited to share **Cyber Grimoire**, a personal project born from my desire to give back to the community that has given me so much. Like many of you, a lot of what I’ve learned about cybersecurity came from free resources generously shared by others. People took time out of their lives to create and distribute content that helped me grow, and now I want to do the same.

## A Personal Project with a Purpose

This project is my way of contributing what I’ve learned back to the community. It’s a space where I document my journey through the world of cybersecurity—sharing knowledge, tips, and insights that I’ve picked up along the way. Think of it as an ever-evolving journal, where I continue to add new information as I come across it. My hope is that it can serve as a useful resource for others who are on a similar path.

## A Community Effort

While this started as a personal project, I envision it growing into a community-driven effort. If you have knowledge, notes, or insights you’d like to share, I warmly invite you to contribute. This project isn’t about personal gain or recognition; it’s about creating something valuable and freely available for everyone. If you’re passionate about cybersecurity and want to share what you know, your contributions are more than welcome.

## No Profit, Just Passion

There’s no profit motive behind this project—just a genuine interest in the subject, a desire to learn, and a commitment to sharing what I know with others. I’m doing this because I find it interesting, fun, and above all, useful. If it helps even one person on their cybersecurity journey, then it’s been worth it.

## Honoring Authorship

Integrity is important to me. I have no desire to take credit for work that isn’t mine. If you notice any missing references or attributions, please let me know so I can give proper credit where it’s due. This project is about sharing knowledge, not claiming ownership of ideas that belong to others.
